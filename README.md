KasaFlip is a one-stop flip analysis tool.
Create a profile, upload MLS data, tweak assumptions, and instantly see whether a property is profitable or not.

Core Features
- Profiles & saved data
    Create an account, keep your preferences (target ROI, closing/holding cost defaults, reno $/sqft), and save deals.
- MLS import
    Upload MLS CSVs; KasaFlip parses them and builds a worksheet of candidate flips (ppsf, DOM, ARV proxy, flags).
- Profitability check
    Auto-compute MAO, profit, ROI, and cash needed using your assumptions.
    Clear “profitable / negotiable / not profitable” badge per property.
- Adjustable assumptions
    Edit renovation duration and cost allocations (e.g., kitchen, baths, roof, exterior, HVAC).
    Toggle soft costs (closing, agent, holding, contingency) and the numbers recalculate live.
- Notes per deal
    Add inspection notes, scope items, or comps commentary on each saved house; notes are stored with the property and affect totals if they include cost details.
- Saved deals
    Bookmark promising properties, compare side-by-side, and revisit with updated assumptions.

How it Works (Flow)
1. Upload MLS file.
2. KasaFlip normalizes fields (address, beds, baths, sqft, list/sold price, DOM, HOA, taxes, etc.).
3. We compute quick after renovation value proxy (ppsf/comps), maximum allowable offer (70% rule baseline or your target), and profit/ROI.
4. Open a deal, add notes and adjust reno budget/duration & cost buckets → totals update instantly.
5. Save deals to your profile and compare.
